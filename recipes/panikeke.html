            <ol>
                <li>Whisk flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Stir in water, bananas, and vanilla until combined; dough will be smooth and sticky.</li>
                <li>Heat 3 inches oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Working in batches of four to five at a time, scoop a scant 1/4 cup batter with a large spoon, then use another spoon to gently push it off into the deep fryer. Fry until panikeke float to the top and turn golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. </li>
            </ol>
