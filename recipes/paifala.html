            Method
        </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 175Â°C.</li>
                <li>Grease the base and sides of a large Pyrex lasagne dish generously with butter.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar then stir in the egg yolks and mix well.</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour one cup at a time, then knead the mixture in the bowl with your hands until it comes together. Turn it out onto the bench and knead lightly to a smooth dough that doesn't stick to your hands.</li>
                <li>Break the dough into pieces and starting at the rim of the dish, press the dough onto the sides and then the base until covered. Use a can from your pantry to roll over the base and sides to smooth them. Prick all over with a fork. Bake for 30-35 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place the pineapple pieces in a sieve and crush lightly with a masher to make smaller chunks.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed pineapple and leave to drain.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, heat the water, 1 cup of the milk and the sugar. Stir and bring to the boil.</li>
                <li>In small mixing bowl, combine the custard powder and the remaining cup of milk and mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>When the liquid has boiled, reduce the heat and whisk in the custard mixture, stirring continuously until it starts to thicken.</li>
                <li>Add the drained pineapple and stir. Simmer, stirring until the mixture is a thick, dolloping consistency. Pour into the baked case. Once cooled, chill in the fridge until set.</li>
                <li>To serve: Stir the Anchor Thickened Cream lightly in its pottle, then dollop on top of the chilled pie and spread with a spatula. Use a fork to make swirls in the cream and decorate with canned peaches and seasonal fruit.</li>
                <li>Cook's tip: Toppings can include fresh seasonal fruit or canned fruit, toasted coconut or chopped nuts. The combination of pineapple pieces and crushed fruit gives a nice texture but you can use all crushed pineapple if you prefer.</li>
            </ol>
